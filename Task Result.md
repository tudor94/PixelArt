# Task Result

## Used technologies / Frameworks

I use the following technologies / frameworks in my project:

- JavaScript

One of the reasons I chose Javascript was for simplicity's sake. I felt that for this task, I could be able to achieve the desired results using plain Javascript and a few small libraries. Another reason for my choice, is the fact that I took it as a learning opportunity in order to further improve my knowledge.
